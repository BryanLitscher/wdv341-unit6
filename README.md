Assignment: Create a form page for the events.  

Gather the information for an event using a form.

It will display a form that can be used to input the information for an event.
Use your database field names as your name attributes in the HTML of the form. 
The action attribute of your form will call the insertEvents.php page that we started in class.

Use PHP, PDO and SQL to process the form data into your database. 

It will connect to your wdv341 database using your database connection page. 
Include this into your eventsForm.php page.
It will access the wdv341_event table.  
Use a PDO Prepared Statement to code and process a SQL INSERT command to insert the form data into your table.
